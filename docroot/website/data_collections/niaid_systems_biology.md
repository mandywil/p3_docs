# NIAID Systems Biology

The NIAID Systems Biology for Infectious Diseases Research Program develops and validates predictive models of infectious disease initiation, progression, and outcomes. These models are derived from the study of the architecture and dynamics of systems-wide host/pathogen molecular interaction networks during infection, using integrated datasets generated from a combination of “omics” technologies. The research findings will provide a deeper understanding of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical, and biophysical molecular processes within microbial organisms as well as their interaction with the host. The programs provide data and reagents that result from the research conducted and provide training for the broader infectious disease scientific community to promote the use of the systems biology approach.


## Systems Biology: Antibacterial Resistance Program
There are six centers that conduct systems biology research specific to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The purpose of these projects is to identify, quantify, model, and predict the molecular interactions of AMR bacterial pathogens and their host during infectious disease initiation and progression or in response to antibacterial treatment.

## Systems Biology: The Next Generation Program
The centers in the Systems Biology: The Next Generation Program conduct research to develop and validate predictive models of infectious disease initiation, progression, and outcomes. These models are derived from the study of the architecture and dynamics of systems-wide host/pathogen molecular interaction networks during infection. The research findings will provide a deeper understanding of the overall complexity of the biological, biochemical, and biophysical molecular processes within microbial organisms, as well as their interaction with the host, and help researchers identify targets for the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
