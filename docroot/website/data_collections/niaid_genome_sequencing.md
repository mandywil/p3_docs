# NIAID Genome Sequencing

## The Genomic Centers for Infectious Diseases (GSCID)

Many of the genomes and their metadata available at the BRCs come from the GCIDs.   The GCIDs will use and develop or improve innovative applications of genomic technologies, such as RNA sequencing and metagenomics, and provide rapid and cost-efficient production of high-quality genome sequences of microorganisms, invertebrate vectors of infectious diseases, and hosts and host microbiomes related to [NIAIDâ€™s list of emerging infectious diseases/pathogens](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens).

Several of the projects conducted by the GCIDs have a focus on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A [consolidated list](https://www.patricbrc.org/webpage/website/data_collections/content/niaid_antimicrobial_resistance_sequencing_projects.html) of these projects is available at PATRIC.
