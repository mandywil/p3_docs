PATRIC Privacy Policy
=====================

The PATRIC Bioinformatics Resource Center is provided as a public resource. PATRIC reserves the right to monitor any and all use of patricbrc.org. This Privacy Policy describes the ways PATRIC collects, stores, uses, discloses, and protects the personal information about users and how they use PATRIC. A link to this policy appears in the footer of patricbrc.org webpages and other prominent locations such as the Register page where it must be acknowledged to obtain a PATRIC Login account. PATRIC never collects information for commercial marketing or any purpose unrelated to PATRIC functions.

Information PATRIC Collects
---------------------------

Some functions of PATRIC may be used without a PATRIC Login, in which case PATRIC does collect some information about your visit to the website to help us understand how PATRIC is being used and might be improved. If you choose to have a PATRIC Login you are asked to provide your name and an email address so we may contact you if needed. This information is also in your personal profile, which is private.

PATRIC Usernames are not treated as personal information and it is recommended that you not include personal information in your Username.

User-Provided Personal Information and Data
-------------------------------------------

You may, at your discretion, also provide in your personal profile further biographical information including First Name, Last Name, Organization, Organisms (that you study), and (research) Interests.  PATRIC does not track information in your personal workspace. Access to this information is strictly under your control to share or make public. Once you designate data shared or public, you should be aware that other users of PATRIC will be able to access and use them.

User Behavior Data Collection
-----------------------------

**Website Usage via Google Analytics**

PATRIC uses Google Analytics to track website traffic specifically to monitor overall trends in website hits, sessions, average pages accessed, average session duration, and total number of new and returning users.  On occasion, we will focus in on a particular period in time (week, day) and location (country, city, network) if we notice an unusual spike in usage to understand if the spike is due to a PATRIC event such as a workshop, conference presentation, or other. 

Google Analytics mainly uses first-party cookies to report on visitor (aka. user) interactions on Google Analytics customers’ websites. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie. `Learn more <https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies>`_.

In addition, Google Analytics supports an optional browser `add-on <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>`_ that, once installed and enabled, disables measurement by Google Analytics for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only disables Google Analytics measurement.

Google Analytics also collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give website owners a sense of which country, state, or city in the world their users come from (also known as "IP geolocation"). Note that website owners have access to their users’ IP addresses even if the website owners do not use Google Analytics.

**Job Service Logging**

When you are logged in to PATRIC and use PATRIC Services, usage information is automatically recorded by your Username, including what services you used. For the individual Service jobs (launching and running a Service), we collect information about the job (workspace location of input data, workspace location of output data, parameters chosen, etc); information about which of the servers in our infrastructure ran it; and time taken for the run. We don't have any organized collection of detailed information about resources used, though some could be computed if necessary.

We aggregate this information to monitor overall usage of each of the Services. On occasion, if there is an unusually heavy load or spike in usage of a particular Service, we may review Service job logs to see if it is being driven by a particular user or for diagnostic purposes. We might also contact a user by email if we notice an unusual number of job failures to assist that user and help diagnose the issue. 

How Information Collected by PATRIC is Used
-------------------------------------------

Private personal information is only accessible to PATRIC staff and will only be used individually in the event we need to contact you. If you choose to provide that information to PATRIC independently (for example when emailing to request help), again it will only be used by PATRIC staff for the purpose of responding. On a semi-annual basis, PATRIC generates reports for our sponsor, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), that include aggregate information such as the number of help requests, statistics on the topics of requests and resolutions. 

Aggregated usage information based on user behavior is used by PATRIC to produce overall statistics such as to show users which webpages are most accessed and which services are most popular. Usage information is also used by PATRIC for internal purposes such as to manage and improve capabilities and Services, the website and related features and content, and to enable users to easily and productively navigate the website and utilize PATRIC capabilities for research benefit. Additionally, the ways users interact with the system are analyzed when errors occur and in aggregate for analysis of PATRIC operation and improvement.

Aggregated usage analyses do not link to individual personal information but may include results broken down by aggregated information, for example, geographic region.

Users should also understand that once their research data is made public that PATRIC reserves the right to integrate this information into meta-analyses that the PATRIC system might perform.

Information PATRIC Discloses
----------------------------

PATRIC is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of users’ personal private information and data. PATRIC considers this information to be private and held in confidence or shared as designated under user control until a user makes it public.

Usage information is used for privately reporting to our sponsor, NIH/NIAID, for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the overall project. No individually identifiable information is reported or disclosed.

How Information PATRIC Collects is Protected
--------------------------------------------

PATRIC restricts access to nonpublic, personal information to those staff and service providers involved in administering and servicing logins, service, and website usage. Physical, electronic and procedural safeguards are in place that comply with Federal standards to protect such information.
