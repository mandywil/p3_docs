# How to enable Adobe Flash Player

## Google Chrome

[Download Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

The Adobe Flash Player plugin is built into Google Chrome. You do not need to download it. Chome will prompt you to "Allow" Adobe Flash to run if you haven't given it authorization to do so yet.

To "Allow" Flash on your current website click the **lock** or **info** button in your URL bar and select **Site Settings**:

Locate the Flash menu dropdown in the new tab that opens and select **Allow**:

Go back to your previous tab and you'll be prompted to reload the page:

The Adobe Flash Player plugin is now set to "Always" allow for this website.

To set it back to "Ask (default)" or "Block" you may click the **lock** or **info** button in your URL bar again and modify your Flash setting (you will need to reload the page again):

## Mozilla Firefox
