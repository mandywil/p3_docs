Updates:
--------------

**New Genomes**

In this release, PATRIC has added over 9,200 new genomes and associated metadata, bringing the total number of genomes and plasmids to over 215,000. The corresponding FTP download files and BLAST databases are updated as well. The full list of available microbial and host genomes can be accessed `here
<https://www.patricbrc.org/view/GenomeList/?or(keyword(Bacteria),keyword(Archaea),keyword(Eukaryota))#view_tab=genomes>`__. 

**Other Enhancements**
PATRIC now provides an alternate URL scheme that uses genus+species names at the end of the URL string instead of taxonomy IDs for accessing taxonomic levels in the site.  For example, the full *Mycobacterium* genus taxon level can be accessed at https://patricbrc.org/view/Taxonomy/Mycobacterium and the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
species taxon level can be accessed at https://patricbrc.org/view/Taxonomy/Mycobacterium+tuberculosis. This provides a more intuitive naming scheme for easily sharing URLs for PATRIC for specific organism groups.
