Data Updates:
--------------

**New Genomes**

In this release, PATRIC has added over 15,000 new genomes and associated metadata, bringing the total number of genomes and plasmids to over 180,000. Included are 9,691 new bacterial and archeal genome from GenBank and 5,278 new *Salmonella enterica* genomes from the FDA that have AMR panel data. The *Salmonella* genomes were assembled and annotated by PATRIC.  The full list of available microbial and host genomes can be accessed `here
<https://www.patricbrc.org/view/GenomeList/?or(keyword(Bacteria),keyword(Archaea),keyword(Eukaryota))#view_tab=genomes>`__.


New Website Features:
----------------------

**Bacteriophage Resource**

PATRIC now has bacteriophage genome data and related functionalty. Included are 4,722 phage genomes from GenBank, annotated using PATRICâ€™s phage-specific annotation service. Phage protein families have been constructed to support comparative analysis. The `Similar Genome Finder Service
<https://patricbrc.org/app/GenomeDistance>`_ can be used to identify similar genomes and phage genes and proteins cam be searched using the new phage-specific `BLAST
<https://patricbrc.org/app/BLAST>`_ databases.  All phages and related data are accessible from the PATRIC homepage, `here
<https://patricbrc.org/view/Taxonomy/10239>`_.
