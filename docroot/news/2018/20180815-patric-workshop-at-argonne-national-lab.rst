PATRIC/RAST Workshop at Argonne National Laboratory, October 23-25, 2018
=========================================================================

.. feed-entry::
   :date: 2018-08-15

The PATRIC/RAST teams will be offering a tutorial workshop October 23-25, 2018, at Argonne National Laboratory in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. The workshop will run for three days, with the third day optional and devoted solely to participants working on their own problems with help from the PATRIC/RAST team members.

The workshop will be limited to 40 people on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no fee for the workshop, but participants are responsible for their own travel expenses. If you wish to participate, we encourage you to respond quickly at <rast-workshop@mcs.anl.gov>.

NOTE: All workshop attendees must also separately fill out the “Argonne Visitor Request” form at: <https://apps.anl.gov/registration/visitors> as soon as possible — but especially non-U.S. Citizens, since they will take additional time to be cleared. Please enter Lisa Hundley, <lhundley@anl.gov>, for the “Sponsor’s e-mail address.”
